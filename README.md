# chtMultiRegionReactingFoam
OpenFOAM transient solver for buoyant, turbulent fluid flow and solid heat conduction with conjugate heat transfer between solid and fluid regions, plus combustion with chemical reactions.

# Notes
1. Compiles with OpenFOAM-dev (last benchmarked 17-Aug-16).
NOTE: Does not compile on OpenFOAM 4.0.  Please contact us if interested in this solver for OpenFOAM 3.0.x or 4.0.x.
2. Release includes transient and steady state solvers (chtMultiRegionReactingFoam and chtMultiRegionSimpleReactingFoam).
3. Unsteady state solver benchmarked against DETCHEM, FLUENT and reactingFoam.
